# Covid-19-Data-Visualization-Folium

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing the daily COVID-19 vaccination data by country, with a specific emphasis on the top 5 countries with the highest vaccination numbers prior to 2022. An interactive map created using Folium displays markers for these countries, indicating the highest number of daily vaccinations reported and the names of the vaccines used.

## Features
- Data analysis of daily COVID-19 vaccinations by country.
- Interactive map visualization with Folium.
- Insight into the top 5 countries with the highest vaccination rates before 2022.

## Running the Script on Jupyter Notebook

1. Launch Jupyter Notebook.
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
2. In the Jupyter Notebook interface, navigate to and open the project notebook (`Covid 19 Data Visualization.ipynb`).
3. Run the notebook cells sequentially or use the `Run All` option in the `Cell` menu to execute the entire notebook.

### Note
GitHub may not fully render Jupyter notebooks. For a complete view of the output, it's recommended to run the notebook locally in Jupyter Notebook or use Google Colab.
