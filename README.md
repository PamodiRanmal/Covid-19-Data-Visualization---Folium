# Covid-19-Data-Visualization-Folium


In this project, the number of daily vaccinations against covid 19 has been analyzed based on countries. The final output shows the top 5 countries that had the highest number of daily vaccinations prior to 2022 on a Map created with Folium. On the final map, we have markers on the top five countries and when we click on each marker it shows the highest number of daily vaccination reported and the names of the vaccines that were used.
